Nobody was documenting the fixes we needed. So we started doing it ourselves.

**Built on a CRT-themed template. Because jank is part of the charm.**

# June 2025.
Picture this. It's June, 2025. A PS5 controller L2 begins failing.

Search online; no disassembly guides, much less fixes or workarounds.

Get my precision set screwdrivers out, dismantle the controller, carefully remove gears for L2 trigger, reassemble with one main gear in reverse, et voilà, one fully functioning L2.
