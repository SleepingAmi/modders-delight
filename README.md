Picture this. It's June, 2025. A PS5 controller L2 begins failing.

Search online; no disassembly guides, much less fixes or workarounds.

Get my precision set screwdrivers out, dismantle the controller, carefully remove gears for L2 trigger, reassemble with one main gear in reverse, et voil√°, one fully functioning L2.

In essence, Modders Delight is the idea that spawned from fixing a simple failure with a PS5 controller... and fruit of my labour.
